Thank you for your interest in participating in this listening test. 

The aim with this study is to identify whether different types of drum strokes can be identified based on their sound. This will provide us knowledge to better understand human perception of timbre (or "sound colour") and how musicians control it. There is no personal compensation or gain in your participation other than the opportunity to assist in better understanding how we perceive and communicate with sounds.

The test will take approximately 20 minutes and consists of four parts: 

1) A brief sound calibration, where we will ask you to to adjust your listening level.

2) A training session, where you will hear the type of sounds that will appear in the test.

3) The actual listening test, where you will be asked to listen and classify 40 sounds in total.

4) A questionnaire, where we will ask you some general personal information such as your age, country of origin, and musical experience. 

Your participation is completely voluntary, and you can withdraw from the test at any point without any consequences for you. Your identity is not known to any of the researchers involved. The collected data will remain anonymous and will be used for research purposes only.
 
If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact Associate Professor Sofia Dahl ([sof@create.aau.dk](mailto:sof@create.aau.dk)) who is responsible for the study.

Before we can start the test, we will ask you to do a brief calibration to adjust your listening level. This will help us assess that the sounds are played in a good enough quality. Please wear headphones while taking the test.

You will now listen to a set of drum strokes played with two different instructions: "Normal" and "Controlled".

For "Normal" strokes, the player was instructed to play a mezzoforte stroke using a normal technique.

For "Controlled" strokes, the player was instructed to stop the drumstick as soon as possible AFTER the stroke. That is, the drumstick should come to rest as close as possible to the drum skin.

For the following 6 strokes, please listen and select whether you believe them to be "Normal" or "Controlled" strokes. You will receive feedback, can keep listening carefully to hear what you perceive to be the difference between "Normal" and "Controlled" strokes in terms of sound. The differences are likely to be subtle.

Please read this information carefully before starting the training session. Then click "Start" when you are ready.
